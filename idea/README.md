AIM- We aim to make women feel as strong as ever and strong enough to fight the parasites of our society, strong enough to fight the odds, strong enough to protect themselves against any sexual assaults. We aim at giving power to those without whom we cease to exist. Our idea is to design a Website which shall make every place and every hour safer for women . A Website which shall re-establish how very gregarious mankind is. 

In this website , first of all there is a homepage having navbar ,login/signup buttom , some important info and an emergency button ,user can first reach the website through the link and register themselves using signup button , at the time of registeration they are asked to put 4 emergency contacts. there is an emergency button which user can use if they are in any emergency situation. when they click the emergency button-
This Website will contain a  geotag and send SOS alert to the nearest police station, close contacts and also alert people in and around the venue of the crime, everything just at a click of a button. The idea is to make up for the time it takes police to arrive at the location.
